Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of information retrieval and text generation. RAG systems work by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and then using those documents as context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.

The RAG process typically involves several key steps:

1. Document Ingestion: Raw documents are processed and split into manageable chunks
2. Embedding Generation: Each chunk is converted into a dense vector representation using embedding models
3. Indexing: Vectors are stored in a vector database like FAISS for efficient similarity search
4. Query Processing: User queries are also converted to embeddings
5. Retrieval: Similar documents are found using vector similarity search
6. Generation: The retrieved context is used to generate a response using a language model

RAG systems are particularly effective because they can access up-to-date information and provide citations for their responses, making them more trustworthy than traditional language models that rely solely on their training data.

Hybrid retrieval combines both dense vector search (semantic similarity) and sparse keyword search (BM25) to improve recall and ensure that both semantically similar and keyword-relevant documents are retrieved.
