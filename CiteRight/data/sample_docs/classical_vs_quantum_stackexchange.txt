Question: What is the difference between classical and quantum mechanics?

Answer: Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects using Newton's laws, while quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales.

Key differences:

1. Determinism vs. Probability: Classical mechanics is deterministic - given initial conditions, you can predict exact future states. Quantum mechanics is probabilistic - you can only predict probabilities of different outcomes.

2. Continuous vs. Discrete: Classical physics treats energy and other quantities as continuous. Quantum mechanics shows that energy comes in discrete packets called quanta.

3. Measurement: In classical physics, measurement doesn't affect the system being measured. In quantum mechanics, measurement fundamentally changes the system (wave function collapse).

4. Superposition: Classical objects exist in definite states. Quantum particles can exist in superposition - multiple states simultaneously until measured.

5. Uncertainty: Classical physics allows precise measurement of all properties. Quantum mechanics has fundamental limits (Heisenberg uncertainty principle).

The transition from classical to quantum behavior occurs at the Planck scale, roughly 10^-35 meters. At everyday scales, quantum effects are negligible and classical mechanics provides excellent approximations.

This is why we can use classical physics for engineering bridges and cars, but need quantum mechanics for understanding atoms, lasers, and semiconductors.
