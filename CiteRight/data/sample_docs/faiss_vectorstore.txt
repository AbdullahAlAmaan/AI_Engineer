FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It provides several key advantages for RAG systems:

Performance: FAISS is optimized for speed and can handle millions of vectors efficiently. It supports both CPU and GPU acceleration.

Scalability: The library can scale to billions of vectors while maintaining fast search times through various indexing strategies.

Index Types: FAISS offers multiple index types including:
- Flat indexes for exact search
- IVF (Inverted File) indexes for approximate search
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for high-dimensional vectors
- PQ (Product Quantization) for memory efficiency

Integration: FAISS integrates well with popular ML frameworks and can be easily incorporated into RAG pipelines.

Memory Management: The library provides efficient memory management and supports both in-memory and disk-based storage.

FAISS is particularly useful in RAG systems where you need to quickly retrieve the most relevant document chunks from a large corpus based on semantic similarity to the user's query.

The library was developed by Facebook AI Research and is open-source under the MIT license. It has become a standard tool in the machine learning community for vector similarity search applications.
